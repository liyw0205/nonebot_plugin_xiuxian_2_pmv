# Cave dwelling

## 用户流程
The compatibility command remains available while the new application boundary is enabled.

## 命令与别名
The historical package owns command names during the compatibility release. New names are added only through this feature manifest.

## Web API
No new HTTP route is exposed in this migration slice. Existing URLs remain served by the legacy web adapter.

## 数据模型与迁移
`legacy.dongfu.001` remains the original feature marker in `game_db`. `dongfu.002` and `dongfu.003` create the successful- and failed-infiltration operation ledgers. Both `潜入洞府` settlement outcomes now use feature repositories directly, while the other cave-dwelling actions retain their independent compatibility paths.

## 事务与失败回滚
Mutating calls carry an `operation_id` and are recorded in the operation ledger. Disable the feature flag or restore the pre-migration backup to roll back.

## 定时任务
No new scheduled jobs. Legacy jobs stay registered through the compatibility scheduler.

## 配置项
`dongfu_enabled` controls the application boundary and defaults to true.

## 适配器差异
Command and web adapters translate transport input into the application DTO; business code does not import NoneBot or Flask.

## 测试与手工验收
Run the feature application test and the full architecture gate. Repeat the same operation ID to verify replay.

## 灰度开关、回滚和已知限制
Other cave-dwelling algorithms and schemas remain behind compatibility adapters for one complete release cycle; the compatibility hit counter determines when removal is safe. A code rollback can keep the infiltration operation ledgers. Removing `dongfu.002` or `dongfu.003`, if ever required, needs restoration from the pre-migration database backup.
